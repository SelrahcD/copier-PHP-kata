# {{kata_name}}

## Getting started

Run `composer install` to get dependencies.

## Run tests

You can run tests with PhpUnit using `./vendor/bin/phpunit`.

{% if tell_about_test_run_logger %}A Test Run Logger is installed and logs all test runs. At the end of the kata you
can take a moment to review the logs and see if you see strange patterns. To make it easier
to review you can write the time when you're entering or leaving a refactoring phase, or when
you're facing difficulties. If you see something weird, what could have you done differently to avoid it?
